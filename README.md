Game Title: Return of the Grim King

Pitch: Save the world from a grim fate

Audience and Genre: A puzzle-solving action rpg designed for fans of fantasy adventures. 

A fantasy adventure RPG, designed for players who enjoy mythological worlds, character building/progression, and lore.
Synopsis: A band of adventurers came together to celebrate 10 years since they defeated the tyrannical Grim King. While the others have moved on to more peaceful lives in farming, music, and architecture, you continued your training. The morning after the celebration, you wake to see your allies gone, and you smell the stench of the Grim King. It is now up to you to reach and defeat this foe once again, else the lives of your allies will be lost. You arm yourself with your sword and shield, and make your way through the Dark Forest, towards the Grim King's fortress.

Mechanics:
Sword Slash -  Charged sword attack striking down on foes.
Shield Block - Raising shield to take incoming attacks, avoiding damage.
Parry - Time block to deflect an enemyâ€™s strike, opening them up for a counterattack. 
Exploring/Inventory - Navigating forests, and dark ruins (dungeons) while collecting and equipping loot/magical items. 
Dialog -  Interacting with NPCs with dialog that may later affect characters.

Flowboard:
Character wakes up -> Discovers that allies are missing -> Prepares to save them -> Navigates through the Dark Forest, defeating enemies and collecting loot -> Reaches the Grim King -> Defeats the Grim King -> Chooses to spare or kill him -> The allies you saved have another celebration in your honor
